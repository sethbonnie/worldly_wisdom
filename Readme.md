Building and Installing
-----------------------
    
- First clone and cd into the app directory then run
    $ npm install
    $ npm build

  This installs all the necessary dependencies and generates the angular application referenced in the main jade file (`views/app.jade`).

- Then to start the application run
    $ npm start
