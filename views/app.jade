          h1.maxim-title The Art Of Mastering Your Passions

          p.maxim-body.
            If possible, oppose the vulgar advances of passion with prudent 
            reflection. This is not difficult for a truly prudent person. 
            The first step toward mastering a passion is to acknowledge that
            you are in a passion. By this means you begin the conflict with
            command over your temper, for one has to regulate one's passion
            to the exact point that is necessary and no further. You should
            know how and when best to come to a stop âˆ’ and is it is most
            difficult to halt while running double-time. It is a great proof
            of wisdom to remain clear-sighted during episodes of rage. Every
            excess of passion is a digression from rational conduct. But by
            this masterful policy, reason will never be transgressed, nor pass
            the bounds of its own moral wisdom. To keep control of passion one
            must hold firm the reins of attention; he who can do so will be the
            first person "wise on horseback", and probably the last.
