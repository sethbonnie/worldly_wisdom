h1.maxim-title The Art Of Mastering Your Passions

p.maxim-body.
  If possible, oppose the vulgar advances of passion with prudent 
  reflection. This is not difficult for a truly prudent person. 
  The first step toward mastering a passion is to acknowledge that
  you are in a passion. By this means you begin the conflict with
  command over your temper, for one has to regulate one's passion
  to the exact point that is necessary and no further. You should
  know how and when best to come to a stop âˆ’ and is it is most
  difficult to halt while running double-time. It is a great proof
  of wisdom to remain clear-sighted during episodes of rage. Every
  excess of passion is a digression from rational conduct. But by
  this masterful policy, reason will never be transgressed, nor pass
  the bounds of its own moral wisdom. To keep control of passion one
  must hold firm the reins of attention; he who can do so will be the
  first person "wise on horseback", and probably the last.
